      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br>Monstera <br>(Monstera deliciosa)

        <br><br> <br> Bold, iconic, and instantly recognizable, the Monstera—also known as the Swiss Cheese Plant—is a
        favorite among plant enthusiasts and interior designers alike. Its dramatic, fenestrated leaves make it a
        statement piece that adds tropical elegance to any space.</h5>
      <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>Native to the rainforests of Central and South America, the Monstera is a climbing plant known for its large,
        glossy green leaves with natural splits and holes. These unique perforations help the plant withstand strong
        winds and capture sunlight in its natural habitat. With proper care, Monsteras can grow impressively tall and
        wide, bringing lush greenery to your home.

        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
        Monsteras thrive in bright, indirect light, mimicking the dappled sunlight of their native rainforest
        floors. They can tolerate lower light conditions but may grow more slowly and develop fewer leaf splits. Avoid
        direct sunlight, which can scorch their leaves.

        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>
        Water your Monstera when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. It prefers consistently moist but
        not soggy soil. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the pot has adequate drainage. During the cooler
        months, reduce watering frequency as growth slows down.
        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Loves higher humidity but adapts well to standard indoor conditions; mist occasionally to
        boost moisture.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b> Thrives in temperatures between 65-85°F and dislikes cold drafts.
        <br><b>Soil:</b> Use a well-draining potting mix, ideally one with peat or coco coir for added aeration.
        <br><b> Fertilizer:</b> Feed every 4-6 weeks during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
        <br><b> Support:</b> As a natural climber, Monsteras appreciate a moss pole or trellis for support as they grow.

        <br><b>Fun Fact</b>
        The Monstera’s unique leaf holes have earned it the nickname “Swiss Cheese Plant.” These fenestrations are
        believed to help the plant capture light more efficiently and withstand tropical storms in the wild.

        <br>Whether you’re creating an indoor jungle or adding a touch of sophistication to your space, the Monstera is
        an iconic choice that’s both stunning and surprisingly easy to care for.

      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br>The Aloe Plant</h5>
      <h5><br><br><b> Say hello to the Aloe plant, a timeless favorite known for its soothing gel and striking,
        architectural appearance. Native to arid regions, Aloe plants are not only a beautiful addition to your home but
        also a functional one, with their gel often used for skin soothing and hydration.</b></h5>
      <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>
        Aloe plants are succulents with thick, fleshy leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. Their green or gray-green
        leaves often have small, white speckles or spiny edges, adding a unique texture to any space. Among the many
        species, Aloe vera is the most famous, celebrated for its medicinal properties and ease of care.

        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
        Aloes love bright, indirect light and can even thrive in direct sunlight for a few hours a day. A sunny
        windowsill—preferably south or west-facing—is ideal. If placed outdoors, protect them from harsh afternoon
        sunlight to prevent leaf scorching.

        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>
        As a drought-tolerant succulent, Aloe plants prefer the “soak and dry” method: thoroughly water them, then let
        the soil dry out completely before watering again. Overwatering is their biggest enemy, so ensure their pot has
        proper drainage. In winter, reduce watering frequency as the plant enters a resting phase.
        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Thrives in dry conditions; no need for extra humidity.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b> Enjoys warm temperatures between 55-80°F and doesn’t tolerate frost.
        <br><b>Soil:</b> Use well-draining cactus or succulent soil for best results.
        <br><b>Fertilizer:</b> Feed with a cactus fertilizer once in spring and summer for growth.
        Whether you’re looking for a hardy plant, a natural first-aid kit, or a statement piece for your home, the Aloe
        plant is a perfect choice. Its low-maintenance nature and unique look make it a favorite among beginners and
        seasoned plant lovers alike.

      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br>Money Tree <br>(Pachira aquatica)
        <br><br><br>The Money Tree is a symbol of good fortune and positive energy, making it a cherished addition to
        homes and offices around the world. With its braided trunk and vibrant green leaves, this tropical beauty is as
        stylish as it is meaningful.</h5>
      <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>
        Native to Central and South America, the Money Tree is a fast-growing plant that can adapt to a variety of
        indoor environments. Its five-lobed leaves are said to represent the elements of balance, and its braided trunk

        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
        Money Trees thrive in bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions, making them versatile for
        many settings. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch their leaves, but make sure they get enough light to
        maintain their vibrant green color.

        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>
        The Money Tree prefers consistent watering, but its roots should never sit in water. Allow the top 1-2 inches of
        soil to dry out before watering again. During the growing season (spring and summer), water more frequently, but
        reduce watering in the cooler months. Always ensure the pot has good drainage.

        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Enjoys high humidity but adapts well to standard indoor levels; occasional misting can
        help.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b> Thrives in temperatures between 65-80°F and dislikes drafts or extreme temperature
        changes.
        <br><b>Fertilizer:</b> Feed monthly during spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer.
        <br><b>Pruning:</b> Trim any yellow or dead leaves to keep the plant looking its best.

      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br>The Snake Plant<br>(Sansevieria)
        <br><br><br>The Snake Plant, often called Mother-in-Law’s Tongue, is a timeless favorite among plant enthusiasts. Renowned for its striking upright leaves and exceptional hardiness, this low-maintenance plant is perfect for adding a modern, sculptural vibe to your home.
      </h5>
      <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>
        Native to West Africa, the Snake Plant features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often green with yellow edges or unique variegation. Its ability to thrive in almost any condition makes it a reliable choice for busy or beginner plant parents. As a bonus, the Snake Plant is an excellent air purifier, known to filter toxins like formaldehyde and benzene, improving the air quality of your space.

        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
        The Snake Plant is highly adaptable, thriving in low to bright indirect light. It can even tolerate some direct sunlight, although too much may cause leaf damage. If you’re looking for a plant for a dimly lit corner, the Snake Plant is an ideal choice.
        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>
        Snake Plants prefer the “soak and dry” method: water thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again. They are drought-tolerant and more likely to suffer from overwatering than underwatering. In winter, water sparingly as their growth slows.
        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Adapts to low humidity; no misting is necessary.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b> Thrives in typical indoor temperatures between 60-80°F and tolerates occasional temperature fluctuations.
        <br><b>Fertilizer:</b> Feed lightly with a general-purpose fertilizer once every 2-3 months during the growing season.
      </p>
      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br> The Spider Plant<br>(Chlorophytum comosum)
        <br><br><br>The Spider Plant is a classic favorite, loved for its elegant, arching leaves and ability to thrive with minimal care. Perfect for hanging baskets or tabletops, this versatile plant adds a touch of greenery and charm to any indoor space.
      </h5>
        <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>
          Native to tropical and southern Africa, the Spider Plant is known for its slender, green-and-white striped leaves that cascade gracefully. One of its most endearing features is its “spiderettes”—small offshoots resembling baby spiders that dangle from the plant, which can be easily propagated into new plants. The Spider Plant is also an excellent air purifier, making it a wonderful addition to your home for both aesthetics and wellness.
        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
          Spider Plants thrive in bright, indirect light but are highly adaptable and can tolerate lower light conditions. Avoid prolonged direct sunlight, which can scorch their delicate leaves. A spot near an east or north-facing window is ideal.


        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>
          Spider Plants prefer evenly moist soil, but it’s important to let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings to prevent overwatering. They are fairly drought-tolerant, so it’s better to underwater occasionally than to overwater. In winter, reduce watering frequency as growth slows.
        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Adapts well to average indoor humidity; occasional misting can prevent leaf tips from browning.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b>  Thrives in temperatures between 65-75°F and tolerates occasional fluctuations.
        <br><b>Fertilizer:</b> Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer once a month during spring and summer.
        </p>
      <h5>Plant Spotlight: <br> The Pothos Plant<br>(Epipremnum aureum)
        <br><br><br>The Pothos, also known as Devil’s Ivy, is a superstar among houseplants. Renowned for its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves and easygoing nature, this trailing beauty is perfect for beginners and seasoned plant enthusiasts alike.</h5>
      <p>

        <br><b>General Description</b>
        Native to the Solomon Islands, the Pothos is a versatile, fast-growing plant that thrives in a variety of conditions. Its lush vines can grow up to 10 feet or more indoors, making it ideal for hanging baskets, shelves, or training along a trellis. Pothos comes in several stunning varieties, such as Golden Pothos with its green and yellow leaves, Marble Queen with creamy white variegation, and Neon Pothos with striking chartreuse foliage.
        <br><b>Sunlight Preferences</b>
        Pothos thrives in bright, indirect light, but it’s incredibly adaptable and will grow well in low-light conditions. While it tolerates lower light, more vibrant variegation will appear with brighter, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate leaves.
        <br><b>Watering Needs</b>Water your Pothos when the top 1-2 inches of soil are dry to the touch. It prefers soil that is evenly moist but not soggy, as overwatering can lead to root rot. It’s forgiving if you occasionally forget to water, making it an excellent choice for busy plant parents. Reduce watering during the cooler months as its growth slows.
        <br><b>Humidity:</b> Prefers moderate humidity but adapts to typical indoor levels with ease.
        <br><b>Temperature:</b>  Thrives in temperatures between 65-85°F and dislikes cold drafts.
